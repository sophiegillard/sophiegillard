I'm a junior web developper. I just finished an intensive web development training, during which I acquired skills as a full stack developer. I had the opportunity to specialize in React, .NET and MySQL during a 3 month internship. This experience allowed me to put into practice my newly acquired knowledge and demonstrate my ability to learn quickly and find creative solutions.
